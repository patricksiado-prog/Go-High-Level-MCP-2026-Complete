## 1. Accounts & connectors

| Connector | Busybee | Location ID | Company | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `command`  | Command & Construct | `xZj500PjsflIQg2j9f9D` | — | Railway `fulfilling-growth/production`, domain `…711a.up.railway.app/mcp` |
| `ghl-full` | Frontline Direct | `TXw28sw0Z2rI6tcCDhJY` | `pPN38xtDcG1oUzlklvvv` | Website ATTFIBERHOUSTON.COM |
| `GH;`      | Official GHL MCP (Frontline) | `TXw28sw0Z2rI6tcCDhJY` | `pPN38xtDcG1oUzlklvvv` | `services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp`, OAuth |

- One GHL Private Integration token (`pit-…`) per account = the access. Pinned to ONE
  sub-account via `GHL_LOCATION_ID` in Railway env. Connectors load at SESSION START only.

### ⚠️ Corrections verified 2026-06-07 (supersede the Drive doc)
- **Command location ID is `xZj500PjsflIQg2j9f9D`** — the Drive doc's `xZj500PjsfllQq2j9i9D`
  is a transcription error (confused `l`/`I`, `q`/`g`, `i`/`f`). The ID here is what the live
  deployed busybee uses and what GHL accepts.
- **Command is LIVE** (was "pending"): token authenticates — contacts, pipelines, and phone
  numbers all read 200. The ONLY failure is `get_location` → **401**, i.e. the `pit-` token is
  missing the **`View Locations` (locations.readonly)** scope. Add that scope in GHL; no token
  string change needed. Frontline's busybee has the same gap on `get_location`.
- **The `command` connector is currently missing** from Patrick's Claude Connectors list; the
  dead duplicate `ghl-full` (↗ "Failed to start MCP authorization") is still present and should
  be removed. Re-add `command` and restart the session to reload it.

## 2. Migration status (Frontline → Command)
- **Config/pipelines: moved via snapshot.** Command now has pipeline **"AT&T Leads"**
  (`2V9thfxQpuhn6ZP0Peqt`, cloned from Frontline's `ve4ERf2YoKvuUVQEZb85`; stages
  Lead/Contacted/Closed-Won/Lost) plus **"AT&T Commercial"** (`trc5dwodtc1LBYHikmiK`).
- **Contacts: NOT moved.** Snapshots do not carry contacts. Command holds only **4,983**
  contacts, and they are an **old 2026-05-08 CSV scrape of Wichita, KS auto-repair shops**
  (tags `wichita`/`romeo`, `medium: csv_import`) — no names/emails, some landlines
  (Twilio `30006`), no consent trail. NOT usable for a consented fiber SMS campaign.
- The 45,579 fiber leads remain in **Frontline**. To use them from Command they must be
  **exported and imported** with DND/DNC/invalid flags preserved (consented subset first).

## 3. Phone / SMS setups (verified 2026-06-07)
- **Command** — 3 SMS-capable US local numbers, account `active`, default **+13466840331**
  ("Patrick's number"); also +13466840217, +13613219339.
- **Frontline** — 21 SMS-capable numbers (TX/AL/AZ/OK/LA/MS) + Voice-AI inbound on several,
  default **+15043996804** ("New Orleans").
- **A2P 10DLC unconfirmed on both** (`bundleSid: null`). Capability ≠ registration — verify the
  Trust Center shows **Approved** before any volume, or US carriers will filter outbound.

## 4. Lead intelligence (Frontline)
- 45,579 contacts. Main pipeline `ve4ERf2YoKvuUVQEZb85` (early stage `378c10e3…`, form opt-in
  stage `d2a32c56…`). Lead form `MQwcgmzOAhkOBIJbwO5s` ("Onboarding Info").
- Segments: Kingsville batch (tags `newfiber rs`/`speedy balandan`, warm), Form opt-ins
  (consented, cleanest), Call-tracking junk (tag `invalid`), AI test junk (clean these).
- Do NOT trust `hot-lead`/`fiber-eligible` tags — polluted by test writes. Many null/invalid #s.
- La Porte upload = 319 skip-traced (222 DNC, 187 landline, 190 clean) → DOOR/CALL, not SMS.

## 5. Outreach guardrails (must follow)
- Consented/opted-in/inbound contacts ONLY (forms, replies, YES). Skip dnd/null/invalid/DNC.
- Cold + DNC lists = door/call routes, never SMS blasts. No filter-evasion message variants.
- Personalized opener: Patrick w/ AT&T, fiber available, 1 Gig in the $40s, 2 months free,
  free install, ask for a day/time. GHL auto-appends opt-out — do not add/strip STOP.
- Converse → confirm address → check eligibility → offer 2 windows → book → move opp to booked
  → tag `command-booked`. YES routes live to 832-247-4060; STOP scrubs via workflow.
- TCPA: texting DNC/non-consented = $500–$1,500 per message. Throttle and log.

## 6. Code / deploy
- Curated lead-finder bug fixed on branch `claude/integration-command-control-opts-ULUBC`:
  `crm_find_unworked_leads`/`crm_contact_workspace` searched contacts via GET (→400) and
  omitted the form-submissions `limit` (→422). Fixed: contact search → POST `{locationId,
  pageLimit}`, form submissions `limit=20`. **Live Railway still runs old code until redeployed.**
- Follow-up agent + recipe added: `examples/agents/customer-follow-up-assistant.md`,
  `examples/recipes/customer-follow-up.json`.

## 7. Security
- Rotate the exposed `pit-` token in GHL (was shown in screenshots/docs). Keep it in Railway
  env only. The public busybee URL has NO auth — URL = full account access. Keep it private.
